# ImageFilters

## About

ImageFilters is a set of custom image filters for PPM format images. Currently planned filters include:

- Conway's Game of Life filter: This is an image filter that will run Conway's Game of Life on each color of an image.
  Every different color is treated as a separate instance of the simulation. Blank pixels will be filled with the
  original image to prevent odd effects.
- Blur: This filter will take the average of the colors of surrounding pixels with a user-defined radius and set the
  central pixel to that color for every pixel in the image to create a blur effect

## Purpose

This project was created out of boredom during the Coronavirus pandemic. I wanted to mess more with C to enhance my
skills with it.

## Notice

This project was abandoned, and will most likely not be completed.
